### **Summary: Deepfake and Fake News Detection using Python & DevOps**  

This project focuses on detecting deepfakes (AI-generated media) and fake news using **Python-based AI models** and **DevOps automation**.  

- **Problem Statement:** Deepfakes and misinformation pose serious threats to society. Traditional detection methods are slow and ineffective.  
- **Solution:**  
  - **Deepfake Detection** using deep learning (CNN, GAN analysis).  
  - **Fake News Detection** using NLP models (BERT-based classification).  
  - **DevOps Automation** for real-time detection, deployment, and monitoring.  
- **Key Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NLP, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).  
- **Workflow:** Data collection → Preprocessing → Model Inference → Classification → Deployment & Monitoring.  
- **Future Scope:** Blockchain for content verification and improved model accuracy.
